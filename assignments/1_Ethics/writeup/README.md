## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

If I discovered an exploit I would contact my boss to inform them. I believe this is better than reporting to a consumer watchdog or public because my boss and company can then attempt to figure out a solution or correct path to take concerning the exploit. Someone may argue that the public should be aware if their car is vulnerable, however I believe this would be dangerous as it would allow attackers to take advantage of the exploit.

I would be willing to take it as far up in my company as it is possible to attempt to create a solution to the exploit. I believe it is important to keep this information within members of the company to prevent this information from reaching potential attackers. If my company is unwilling to postpone the ECU’s release I would allow them to make that decision. I would still not go forward and tell the public as this would be worse than doing nothing. It will allow attackers to be aware of the exploit. Additionally, it is possible that the exploit could late be fixed with an update.

I do not believe I should be held responsible. I would have done what I could and told my superiors of the exploits that existed. It would have been a group decision made by the company and boss, therefore one developer cannot be held responsible. I believe the exploit should be recognized by the company. I would feel responsibility if I had not informed my boss.
