## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

To acquire this information I would pose as the victim's bank company. I would convince the victim that their account has been compromised with fake trasnsactions and ask them to view the transactions on a fake website that does not work. I would ask them what browser they are using to explain why it is not working for them. I would then attempt to resolve the issue and cancel the transactions. I could tell the victim that I acquire their PIN number to confirm their identity and to access their account. I would then try to fix their security information by adding more precautions to their account. I would tell the victim I would require some personal information to fix their account for them. I could set up security questions for their account, such as their pets name, their mothers maiden name, and the city she was born in. In order to figure out the web browser, I could ask them to access a fake website to confirm I entered the correct information.
### Part 2 (60 pts)
1. One vulnerabilitie were her open ports on the server. Port 1337 was left open on Elizabeth's server which allowed me to login. I would suggest that she does not leave it open for anyone to prompted to enter a username and password. Additionally 1337 was included in her website url. This can be used as a hint for an attacker that is looking for open ports. 

2. Another vulnerabilitie was that Elizabeth's password was too simple, with linkinpark. Additionally her username was the same as her twitter username. The username was too easy to learn, so an attacker would then just need to figure out the password. A username that is unrelated to any other account should be used. Elizabeth should also create a more complex password that cannot be easily cracked through brute force.   

3. Another vulnerability was the robot.txt, that revealed a secret directory. This makes it easy for an attacker to locate an important directory. This could bre resolved by having a large amount of disallowed directory appear in the robot.txt with vague names. This would make it more difficult for an attacker to pinpoint a specific directory to attempt to breach.
