## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

First, I noticed the server was running the dig command. I then researched command injections to learn how they work. I read that a common vulnerability is when the code is not sanitized properly for user inputs. So I then attempted to use a semicolon ; to end the command and use a new command, for example ;ls. This listed the directories in the server. Therefore,I then attempted to use ;bash which gave me a shell in the server. Within this shell I looked into the home directory and found a flag.txt file which had the flag CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}. In order to prevent this vulnerability I would suggest to sanitize the user input to only allow parsing of domain names and nothing else. This way an attacker will be unable to inject dangerous code.
