## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

First, I noticed it was running the dig command. I then googled command injection and read that a common vulnerability is when the code is not sanitized properly for user inputs. So I then attempted to use a semicolon ; to end the command and use a new command, for example ;ls. This listed the directories in the server. Next I attempted to use ;bash which gave me a shell in the server. 
### Part 2 (60 pts)
